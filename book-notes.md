## Deming's Journey to Profound Knowledge
- **Author:** John Willis (with Derek Lewis)
- **Publisher:** IT Revolution Press (2023)
- **Added:** 2026-02-20
- **Status:** To Read

### What It's About
The story of how W. Edwards Deming developed his **System of Profound Knowledge** — told through the historical events, people, and serendipities that shaped his thinking. Not a biography; it's the origin story of the ideas. Written like a documentary, connecting Deming to Lean, Agile, and DevOps.

### The System of Profound Knowledge (4 Domains)
1. **Appreciation of Systems** — See the bigger picture, not just parts. The opposite of analytic thinking is systems thinking.
2. **Theory of Variation** — Understand how processes behave. Track variation to find defects early.
3. **Theory of Knowledge** — How do we know what we think we know? Rooted in pragmatism and the scientific method (observe → hypothesize → test).
4. **Theory of Psychology** — How do people behave? Workers aren't cogs. Treat them as partners.

### Key Ideas

**Variation is everything:**
- No process produces identical outputs — variation is a fact of life
- **Common cause** variation: inherent to the process, predictable, plan for it
- **Special cause** variation: external, unpredictable, investigate it
- "The root of all evil" = misidentifying which type of variation you're dealing with
- Statistical Process Control (SPC) lets you distinguish random (stable) from non-random (unstable) patterns

**94/6 rule:**
- Only 6% of problems are human error. 94% are system error.
- The system is management's responsibility → 94% of problems are caused by bad management.

**Quality is about process, not product:**
- "Quality is not so much about improving the product as it is about improving the process"
- Defects are a result of process, not workers (Shewhart's insight)
- Less waste = doing more with less

**Management by Means (MBM):**
- If you don't know *how* you achieved your objective, you don't know if you can do it again
- Focus on the method, not just the outcome

**People matter:**
- Ford saw workers as interchangeable cogs; Taylor saw them as machines to optimize
- Both assumed workers don't want to work → adversarial relationship
- Hawthorne Works treated workers as partners — and it worked
- Japanese workers believed they were doing something that mattered
- Piecework incentivizes quantity over quality — "man's lowest degradation"
- Organizations need to be places where people can teach themselves

**Cooperation over competition:**
- Even competitors working together benefits everyone (especially customers)
- "Strive to be better than yourself — that is true competition"
- Deming's real legacy: seeing the grander scheme and preaching cooperation

**On management:**
- "Our problems are different" is a common disease — principles are universal
- To change a system, you need knowledge from *outside* that system
- Eliminate slogans and targets — they create adversarial relationships
- Improve constantly and forever

### Historical Arc
- **WWII**: US outproduced the world thanks to statistical process control, even with millions of skilled workers absent
- **Post-war Japan**: Deming taught SPC and quality to Japanese industry → the "Japanese Miracle"
- **1970s-80s**: Japan dominated manufacturing; US rediscovered Deming ("Demingmania")
- **Modern era**: Deming's ideas are the foundation of Lean, Agile, and DevOps

### Deming's 14 Points for Management
Full list at [deming.org](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points/). Highlights:
- Improve constantly and forever
- Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce
- Drive out fear so everyone can work effectively
- Break down barriers between departments

### Quotable
- "In God we trust. All others must bring data." — Deming
- "I will never apologize for learning." — Deming
- "Perfection is not for this world; it is for some other world."
- "I hope what you have heard here today will haunt you for the rest of your life. Then I have done my best."

## The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement
- **Author:** Eliyahu M. Goldratt & Jeff Cox
- **First Published:** 1984
- **Added:** 2026-02-20
- **Status:** To Read

### Summary
A business novel following Alex Rogo, a plant manager with three months to save his failing factory. Guided by his former professor Jonah, Alex discovers the Theory of Constraints — that every system has a bottleneck, and optimizing anything other than the bottleneck is an illusion of productivity.

### Three Operational Measurements
- **Throughput** — rate the system generates money through sales (money coming in)
- **Inventory** — all money invested in things intended to sell (money in the system)
- **Operating Expense** — all money spent to turn inventory into throughput (money going out)

### The Five Focusing Steps
1. **IDENTIFY** the system's constraint
2. **EXPLOIT** it — maximize output from current resources
3. **SUBORDINATE** everything else to the constraint's pace
4. **ELEVATE** the constraint — invest in increasing its capacity
5. **REPEAT** — when the constraint moves, start over

### Key Ideas
- The goal of any business is to **make money** — everything else is a means
- **Balanced plants don't work** — "the closer you come to a balanced plant, the closer you are to bankruptcy"
- **Bottleneck time is sacred** — an hour lost there is lost for the entire system
- **Busy ≠ productive** — doing work and making money are different things
- **Local optimization is a trap** — optimize the whole system, not individual parts
- **Reduce batch sizes** — smaller batches = faster flow = less inventory
- **Cost-first thinking is wrong** — increase throughput, don't just cut costs

### Quotable
- "The goal is not to reduce cost. The goal is to increase throughput."
- "A plant in which everyone is working all the time is very inefficient."
- "Making an employee work and profiting from that work are two different things."
- "Tell me how you measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave."

## Vibe Coding: Building Production-Grade Software With GenAI, Chat, Agents, and Beyond
- **Authors:** Gene Kim & Steve Yegge
- **Foreword:** Dario Amodei, CEO and Cofounder of Anthropic
- **Publisher:** IT Revolution Press
- **Published:** October 21, 2025
- **Pages:** 320
- **ISBN:** 9781966280026
- **Added:** 2026-02-25
- **Status:** Notes Complete

### Summary
By the authors of The Phoenix Project/DevOps Handbook (Kim) and a veteran of Google, Amazon, and Sourcegraph (Yegge). Explores how vibe coding — using GenAI to generate code from natural language descriptions — is transforming software development. Covers practical strategies from small projects to enterprise-scale applications, with real-world case studies showing dramatic productivity gains while maintaining engineering excellence.

### Key Takeaways
- Vibe coding transforms complex programming into fluid conversations with GenAI
- Developers shift from writing code to directing AI agents — intent and flow over syntax
- One person with AI can achieve what previously required a team
- Build confidently in languages and frameworks you've never used before
- Quality, security, and architecture judgment remain human responsibilities
- AI coding is not just faster — it fundamentally changes how we approach development
- Patience and iteration matter — AI doesn't get it right in one shot

### Core Principles

**From Writing to Directing:**
Developers shift from manual coding to directing AI coding agents. The skill becomes knowing what to ask for, how to evaluate results, and when to intervene.

**FAAFO — Transformative Potential at Scale:**
Real-world case studies show extraordinary results. A developer built 2,600 lines of Python with docs and CLI flags in 2 hours while multitasking. A person who hadn't coded in 20 years built working tools.

**Lowered Barriers, Raised Stakes:**
More people can create software than ever before, but responsibility for quality, security, and architecture becomes more critical — not less.

**Patience and Iteration:**
AI doesn't produce perfect code in one pass. Success comes from iterating, guiding, and refining — treating AI as a collaborator, not a magic wand.

**Co-Creation Over Automation:**
The best results come from mastering the art of co-creating with your AI companion — it's a conversation, not a command.

**Break Free From Traditional Constraints:**
Syntax, setup, and unfamiliar frameworks no longer block progress. Developers can build in languages they've never used before.

### Case Study: Luke Burton's CNC Firmware
Luke Burton (nearly two decades at Apple, including technical readiness for Swift's 2014 WWDC launch) used Claude Code to build a Python program automating CNC firmware uploads — 2,600 lines with documentation and proper CLI flags in 2 hours. His collaborator in Germany was amazed. Luke's response: "You ain't seen nothing yet — give me 15 minutes, and this thing will have an interactive mode with GNU readline support."

### Quotable
- "Science fiction is now reality. Programmers no longer need to toil over code and syntax. They can now describe what they want and watch it materialize instantly."
- "2600 lines of Python with documentation and proper CLI flags. It cost me $50 in Claude Code tokens, but I'm not complaining!"
- "You ain't seen nothing yet — give me 15 minutes, and this thing will have an interactive mode with GNU readline support."
- "Don't get left behind in the biggest transformation our industry has seen since the internet revolution."

### Action Items
- Experiment with AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot) in your daily workflow
- Practice prompt engineering for code generation — specificity and iteration matter
- Build review and testing skills — AI-generated code still needs human judgment
- Try building something in a language or framework you've never used
- Start small: automate a tedious task with AI-assisted coding to build confidence
- Shift mindset from "writing code" to "directing and reviewing AI output"
