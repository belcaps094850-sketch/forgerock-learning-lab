## Summary

A maintenance-focused Sunday. Major work was restructuring cron jobs to save reports into the main repo and push to GitHub, plus diagnosing timeout issues with Pixel's React Radar and Radar's AI Digest jobs. No new features shipped.

## Git Activity

**No commits pushed today** across any repos (forgerock-learning, mission-control, medstoploss, etc.). All changes were configuration-level (cron job updates via OpenClaw gateway).

## Configuration Changes

- **Updated 4 cron jobs** (Sentinel, Scout, Radar, Scribe) to save reports into `forgerock-learning` repo under `reports/` and auto-push to GitHub
- **Repo moved:** `forgerock-learning` relocated from `~/.openclaw/workspace/forgerock-learning/` to `~/workspace/forgerock-learning/` (symlink left at old path)
- **React Radar timeout diagnosed:** Root cause is missing Brave Search API key on uidev agent + job doing too much in one shot
- **Pixel SRE Digest Update:** New cron job created (3:30 AM daily) to separate SRE digest HTML updates from Atlas's scout job

---

## Issues & Action Items

- ⚠️ **React Radar timeout** — Fix Brave API key for uidev agent, bump timeout to 600s
- ⚠️ **Radar AI Digest timeout** — Also timed out; needs investigation
- 📋 **SRE Daily Topic Scout** — Bel requested change from weekdays-only to daily (pending)
- 📋 **mission-control repo** — Has uncommitted changes (flagged by Scout)
