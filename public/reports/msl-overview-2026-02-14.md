## 2. What Problem Does Medical Stop Loss Solve?

### The Core Problem
When employers **self-fund** their health plan (paying claims directly rather than buying fully-insured coverage), they take on **financial risk**. A single catastrophic claim — cancer treatment, organ transplant, premature infant, gene therapy — can cost **$1M-$5M+**. For most employers, one or two of these events could be financially devastating.

### How Stop Loss Solves It

**Specific Stop Loss (Individual)**
- Protects against any **single claimant** exceeding a set dollar threshold (the **attachment point** or **deductible**)
- Typical attachment points: $100K–$500K+ depending on employer size
- Example: Employer sets $200K specific deductible. Employee has a $1.2M transplant claim. Stop loss reimburses $1M.

**Aggregate Stop Loss (Plan-Level)**
- Protects against **total plan claims** exceeding expected levels
- Typically set at 120-125% of expected annual claims
- Acts as a ceiling on the employer's total financial exposure for the year

### Why It Matters

| Without Stop Loss | With Stop Loss |
|---|---|
| Unlimited downside risk | Capped, predictable maximum exposure |
| One catastrophic claim can threaten operations | Financial protection against outlier events |
| CFOs can't budget with confidence | Enables reliable financial planning |
| Only viable for very large employers | Makes self-funding accessible to 100+ life groups |

### Who Needs It?
- **Self-funded employers** (typically 100+ employees, but level-funded products push this to 10+ lives)
- **Municipalities and school districts** — large self-funded public entities
- **Taft-Hartley / union trusts** — multi-employer health funds
- **Captive insurance arrangements** — stop loss as the catastrophic layer above the captive retention

### The Trend
Self-funding is growing because employers want:
- **Cost transparency** (vs. fully-insured black box)
- **Cash flow advantages** (no pre-payment of claims)
- **ERISA preemption** (avoid state insurance mandates)
- **Plan design flexibility**

Stop loss is the **enabler** of self-funding. Without it, only Fortune 500-scale employers could absorb the volatility. With it, mid-market and even small employers can self-fund safely.

## Summary

**Stop loss insurance is the financial safety net that makes self-funded health plans viable.** It caps catastrophic risk at both the individual and aggregate level, turning unpredictable health care costs into manageable, budgetable expenses. The market is large (~$30B+), competitive, and growing as self-funding pushes downmarket. Key players include Sun Life, HM Insurance, Voya, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty, and Tokio Marine HCC, with distribution heavily influenced by major brokers and TPAs.
