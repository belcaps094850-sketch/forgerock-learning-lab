### 📰 "Claude Is a Space to Think" — Ad-Free Commitment

- No third-party product placements
- Revenue model stays subscription + enterprise contracts
- Reasoning: AI conversations are deeply personal and open-ended — ads would undermine trust
- They analyzed conversation data (via Clio, privacy-preserving) and found many conversations involve sensitive/personal topics where ads would be inappropriate
- Acknowledges ad-supported business models create engagement-optimization incentives misaligned with genuine helpfulness

## ⚠️ Note on Data Quality
- **Web search (Brave API) is not configured** — couldn't search Twitter/X or perform targeted queries. Recommend setting up `BRAVE_API_KEY` for richer future digests.
- Reddit JSON API provided good data for top posts but limited to titles/scores (no full discussion text).
- TechCrunch and Ars Technica tag pages rendered without article content (JS-heavy sites).
- For future digests, a browser-based approach might yield richer results from these sources.
